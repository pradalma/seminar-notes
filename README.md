Biological pumop
transform inorganic CO2 into organic C (gross primary production) and produces O2 needed for respiration

Fuels the entire marine food web (microbes to higher trophic levels)

Provides the flux of organic matter exported from surface layers to depth

limited by rate of nutrient delivery to sunlit surface layers

Limited by the rae of avail of nutrients

Imoportant to know the geographic distrubution, rates and mechanisms for ocean warming, acidification, stratification are predicted to afffect regional CO2 drawdown...

Bio C pump represented by ANCP annual net community production

ANCP = Net primary prod phyto - bateria and animals and is equiva to Export Production

Sunlight +H2O +CO2 + Nutrients =Corg +O2 + Energy

nut: NO3 PO4 Fe

Corg : redfield ration determins how the elements are being used in the biol prodctivity

Export of the system:  3 modes 
flux of particulate organic carbon
mixing of dissolved organic carbon : LEAST WELL KNOWN PARTOF THE SYSTEMn accounts for 25%
active transport of zoopolankton migration sediments traps too low estimates

want to be able to determine ancp - carbon export from remote sensing measurements (satellite color, algorithms for ncp:npp ratio)

Emerson 2014 compared estimates of terms in the bio pump at HOT, PAPA and BATS to satellite predictions and found they are close to being experimnetally determined at HOT and PAPA but not BATS

Need to improve accuravy of in sity ANCP estimate from mass balance of metabolites O2 NO3 DIC to calibrate remote sensing

ANCP = 3 modes of transport 

issues with measureing ancp at bats

the estimates using massblanace of metabolites (O2 DIC NO3) exhibit large variances 3.8+_ 1.2 mol C m-2 y-1

siginificant imbalance between experimentally derived ancp and export flux from seiment trraps zooplankto and doc studies
advection?
inefficient capture by traps?
roll of small cells vs diatoms affectiong export efficiency?
direct estimates of new NO3 supply fall short by 50% of the amount needed (0.6+_0.2 mol N M-2 y-1 to support observed ANCP (poor representation of veritcal diffusivity? episodic submesocale)
