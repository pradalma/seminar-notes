Biological pumop
transform inorganic CO2 into organic C (gross primary production) and produces O2 needed for respiration

Fuels the entire marine food web (microbes to higher trophic levels)

Provides the flux of organic matter exported from surface layers to depth

limited by rate of nutrient delivery to sunlit surface layers

Limited by the rae of avail of nutrients

Imoportant to know the geographic distrubution, rates and mechanisms for ocean warming, acidification, stratification are predicted to afffect regional CO2 drawdown...

Bio C pump represented by ANCP annual net community production

ANCP = Net primary prod phyto - bateria and animals and is equiva to Export Production

Sunlight +H2O +CO2 + Nutrients =Corg +O2 + Energy

nut: NO3 PO4 Fe

Corg : redfield ration determins how the elements are being used in the biol prodctivity

Export of the system:  3 modes 
flux of particulate organic carbon
mixing of dissolved organic carbon
active transport of zoopolankton migration

ANCP = 3 modes of transport
